# 🌐 Professional Web Portfolio

This repository contains my **personal Web Portfolio**, created using a **pre-designed template** and customized to reflect my skills, experience, and projects as a **Network & System IT Specialist**.

Although I’m not a web developer, I built this portfolio after attending the workshop **“Valorisez vos compétences avec un portfolio web pro !”** at **Orange Digital Center Rabat**, led by **Soufiane Bakkas**.  
This project helped me step outside my comfort zone and explore some front-end basics to better showcase my IT journey.
